Healthcare is expensive. It is also, in many countries, a human right. How such a costly basic necessity is distributed has been the subject of global policy debate for centuries– and two general approaches have emerged. The first is public healthcare coverage; health services such as physician consultations and lab imaging and health supplies such as prescription drugs are government provisions and individual people pay nothing (or very little) to use health services. The second is private healthcare coverage; private companies offer health serivces and health supplies for varying levels of cost to individual people. US healthcare is almost entirely private coverage. However, there has been much discussion among both government and medical officials as to whether or not this system should change.

The first is public healthcare coverage wherein services such as general and specialist physician office visits, lab testing and medical imaging as well as the  provision of prescription medications and supplies are funded and administered by the national government and individual people pay little or nothing out-of-pocket for health services. The second is private healthcare coverage, wherein private companies–either through private insurance providers or directly–offer health serivces, medications, and supplies  to individual consumers at varying levels of individual cost.

The provision of healthcare is driven by motives which are both competing and synergistic. On the medical side, equitable access to healthcare is important because it recognizes the dignity and value of each person regardless of class. Physicians and other healthcare professionals focus on their patients’ health outcomes to measure the success of their work, but those who do not or cannot access care often have higher mortality rates and less access to care for chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. On the economic side, politicians often focus exclusively on how much healthcare costs. Healthcare expenditures account for more than $12,000 per person annually or 18.3% of GDP. While these figures can be seen generally an expression of the value the nation puts on individual dignity, it flies in the face of the value each person puts on another’s dignity. In other words, private insurance is a measure of our value of self, and decidedly not a measure of how much we are willing to support someone else’s dignity in the form of nationalized healthcare. Americans are loathe to pay taxes to support healthcare for “the poor” through a single payer system.

Healthcare expenditures account for more than $12,000 per person annually or 18.3% of GDP. While these figures can be seen generally an expression of the value the nation puts on collective dignity, they are inapposite to the value each person puts on another’s dignity.

Americans are loathe to pay taxes to support healthcare for “the poor” through a single payer system.
Ironically, Americans already subsidize healthcare for others in at least two ways. First, most people in the US receive healthcare under private insurance through their employers by way of payroll deductions and employer subsidies. Insurance premiums are set based on a byzantine calculation by providers which factors in among other things the cost of hospital write-offs. Second, most elderly and disabled people are covered by Medicare and Medicaid, mini-single payer programs funded by payroll taxes. Even with both private and public insurance systems, however, an estimated 45 million Americans were not covered by insurance of any kind prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Most uninsured people were uninsured because their employers did not provide insurance and they could not afford the premiums on their own.
Introduction: The provision of healthcare is driven by competing motives. On the medical side, equitable access to healthcare is important because it recognizes the dignity and value of each person regardless of class.

Healthcare expenditures account for more than $12,000 per person annually or 18.3% of GDP. While these figures can be seen as an expression of the value the nation puts on collective dignity, they do not reflect the value each person puts on another’s dignity. In other words, private insurance is a measure of our value of self, and decidedly not a measure of how much we are willing to support someone else’s dignity with publicly funded healthcare. Americans are loathe to pay taxes to support healthcare for “the poor” through a single payer system.
Ironically, Americans already subsidize healthcare for others in at least two ways. First, most people in the US receive healthcare under private insurance through their employers by way of payroll deductions and employer subsidies. The cost of private insurance is based on many factors including the cost of indigent care through hospital emergency departments which are providers of last resort. Second, most elderly and disabled people are covered by Medicare and Medicaid. These are mini-single payer programs funded by payroll taxes which pay for chronic illness and end of life care, which are arguably the most expensive interventions. Even with both private and public insurance systems, however, an estimated 45 million Americans were not covered by insurance prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Without a way to pay, people often delay seeking healthcare and as their conditions worsened, they also became more expensive to treat.
Currently, healthcare in the US is funded by a patchwork of public funded, employer provided, and individual market-based payment systems which cover 92% of the population. The overall cost of healthcare has declined under the AHA, and access to care has increased– for most individuals. However, the nation’s collective access to healthcare may have been negatively affected. Many hospitals have closed their emergency departments to cut costs and entire rural hospitals have closed because of declining provider payments, which decreases the availability of services even for privately insured patients. Reigning in the cost of healthcare has also been associated with the closing of rural hospitals and a decline in the number of medical students opting for higher paid specialty positions rather than general practice. Is national healthcare the answer? Does it increase healthcare access and lower costs and improve healthcare outcomes? Or does national healthcare have unanticipated negative effects such that providers choose higher paid positions and facilities eliminate services to cut costs? How do these things affect access to healthcare and health outcomes? In the end, what is the goal of healthcare funding? Is collective cost more important than individual dignity?
