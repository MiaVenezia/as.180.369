Healthcare is expensive. It is also, in many countries, a human right. How such a costly basic necessity is distributed has been the subject of global policy debate for centuriesâ€“ and two general approaches have emerged. The first is public healthcare coverage; health services such as physician consultations and lab imaging and health supplies such as prescription drugs are government provisions and individual people pay nothing (or very little) to use health services. The second is private healthcare coverage; private companies offer health serivces and health supplies for varying levels of cost to individual people. US healthcare is almost entirely private coverage. However, there has been much discussion among both government and medical officials as to whether or not this system should change.
