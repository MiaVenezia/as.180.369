Healthcare is expensive. It is also, in many countries, a human right. How such a costly basic necessity is distributed has been the subject of global policy debate for centuries– and two general approaches have emerged. The first is public healthcare coverage; health services such as physician consultations and lab imaging and health supplies such as prescription drugs are government provisions and individual people pay nothing (or very little) to use health services. The second is private healthcare coverage; private companies offer health serivces and health supplies for varying levels of cost to individual people. US healthcare is almost entirely private coverage. However, there has been much discussion among both government and medical officials as to whether or not this system should change. 
Healthcare is expensive. It is also, in many countries, a human right. How such a costly basic necessity is distributed has been the subject of global policy debate for decades, and two general approaches have emerged. The first is public healthcare coverage wherein services such as general and specialist physician office visits, lab testing and medical imaging as well as the  provision of prescription medications and supplies are funded and administered by the national government and individual people pay little or nothing out-of-pocket for health services. The second is private healthcare coverage, wherein private companies–either through private insurance providers or directly–offer health serivces, medications, and supplies  to individual consumers at varying levels of individual cost. US healthcare is almost entirely private coverage. However, there has been much discussion among both government, public health, and medical officials as to whether or not this system should change.
