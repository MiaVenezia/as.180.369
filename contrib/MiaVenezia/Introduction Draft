Healthcare is expensive. It is also, in many countries, a human right. How such a costly basic necessity is distributed has been the subject of global policy debate for centuries– and two general approaches have emerged. The first is public healthcare coverage; health services such as physician consultations and lab imaging and health supplies such as prescription drugs are government provisions and individual people pay nothing (or very little) to use health services. The second is private healthcare coverage; private companies offer health serivces and health supplies for varying levels of cost to individual people. US healthcare is almost entirely private coverage. However, there has been much discussion among both government and medical officials as to whether or not this system should change. 
The paper will examine public and privatized healthcare systems and identify differences in how these systems affect healthcare access. The effectiveness of these systems will be evaluated on the health outcomes such as longevity and management of chronic disease. Specifically, health outcomes in the US’s private healthcare system will be compared to . ( how to tie in the “factors like in other countries that may affect healthcare access in the US”). The paper will examine arguments both for and against a universal healthcare system for the US and conclude with a recommendation as to an appropriate course of action for US healthcare reformation.
