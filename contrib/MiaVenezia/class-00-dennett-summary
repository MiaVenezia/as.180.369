In his article, “The Problem with Counterfeit People,” Dennett asserts that artificial intelligence (AI) is an immenant threat to human life. The initial purpose of AI was to increase human productivity by providing efficient and immediate access to accurate information. However, AI has evolved beyond its initial enhancement of human mental facilities to become uncannily skilled at immitating all aspects of the human being– from thought, to composition, to mannerisms. Dennett warns that human minds could be “sitting ducks” to such advanced AI capabilities that, with their resemblance to actual humans, could coax out the vulnerabilities of soceity’s most powerful figures and exploit humankind with their findings. Most horrific to Dennett is the ability of the “coutnerfeit people” created by AI to reproduce themselves in a Darwin-like manner to overcome the authenticity verification measures formulated by real humans to determine whether or not they have been deceived. Dennett concludes his pieve by suggesting a legal framework for companies and executives that encourage and implore the unregulated use of AI as a means to remind the public of the “moral obligations” necessary to  further safe technological progress.
