The paper will examine public and privatized healthcare systems and identify differences in how these systems affect healthcare access. Access will be evaluated as a function of health outcomes such as longevity and management of chronic disease. Specifically, health systems in the US, UK, Australia, Indonesia, and Taiwan will be considered, and national economic development as a factor also affecting health care access will be discussed. The paper will examine arguments both for and against a universal healthcare system for the US and conclude with a recommendation as to an appropriate course of action for US healthcare reform.
