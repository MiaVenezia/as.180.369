The paper will examine public and privatized healthcare systems and identify differences in how these systems affect healthcare access. The effectiveness of these systems will be evaluated on the outcomes yielded from different levels of resulting healthcare access such as longevity and management of chronic disease. The US has infamously (insufficient?) private healthcare coverage. ( how to tie in the “factors like in other countries that may affect healthcare access in the US”). The paper will examine arguments both for and against a universal healthcare system for the US and conclude with a recommendation as to an appropriate course of action for US healthcare reformation.
