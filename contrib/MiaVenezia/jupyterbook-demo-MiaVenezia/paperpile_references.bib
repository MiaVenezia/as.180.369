  abstract  = "Recent comparative evidence from OECD countries suggests that
               Australia's mixed public-private health system does a good job
               in ensuring high and fairly equal access to doctor, hospital and
               dental care services. This paper provides some further analysis
               of the same data from the Australian National Health Survey for
               2001 to examine whether the general finding of horizontal equity
               remains when the full potential of the data is realized. We
               extend the common core cross-country comparative analysis by
               expanding the set of indicators used in the procedure of
               standardizing for health care need differences, by providing a
               separate analysis for the use for general practitioner and
               specialist care and by differentiating between admissions as
               public and private patients. Overall, our analysis confirms that
               in 2001 Medicare largely did seem to be attaining an equitable
               distribution of health care access: Australians in need of care
               did get to see a doctor and to be admitted to a hospital.
               However, they were not equally likely to see the same doctor and
               to end up in the same hospital bed. As in other OECD countries,
               higher income Australians are more likely to consult a
               specialist, all else equal, while lower income patients are more
               likely to consult a general practitioner. The unequal
               distribution of private health insurance coverage by income
               contributes to the phenomenon that the better-off and the less
               well-off do not receive the same mix of services. There is a
               risk that - as in some other OECD countries - the principle of
               equal access for equal need may be further compromised by the
               future expansion of the private sector in secondary care
               services. To the extent that such inequalities in use may
               translate in inequalities in health outcomes, there may be some
               reason for concern.",

               attention to community expenditures in health sector and health
               outcomes. This study provides econometric evidence linking
               countries' health expenditures to 3 health outcomes: (1) infant
               mortality, (2) under 5 mortality and (3) life expectancy within
               4 different health care systems. Methods: In this study, we used
               the econometric method to estimate the effect of health
               expenditure on health status. Panel data were collected and
               grouped for 25 countries according to the health care system
               over 15 years (2000-2015). The random effects model was selected
               over the fixed effects model based on the Hausman test to assess
               the effect of different factors on the 3 mentioned health
               outcomes. Results: A significant relationship was found between
               health expenditures and health indicators. The effect of private
               health expenditures on health outcomes in countries with mixed
               health financing system and traditional sickness fund insurance
               was higher than public expenditures. Also, after comparing the
               results between different health care systems, we found that the
               effect of health expenditure on the health outcome in countries
               with national health system (NHS) was more than other health
               care systems. Conclusion: To improve health status, health
               policymakers should focus on the factors that lie inside the
               health care system. Therefore, since private and public health
               expenditures have different effects on health outcomes in each
               health care system, countries should choose an optimal
               combination of private and public health expenditures.",

               Abstract: Background: Private healthcare providers deliver a
               significant proportion of healthcare services in low- and
               middle-income countries (LMIC). Poorer patients get sick and go
               without care more frequently, and spend more of their incomes on
               private healthcare than the wealthy. This review is focused on
               comparing health outcomes in private versus public care
               settings. It seeks to summarize what is known regarding the
               relative morbidity or mortality outcomes that result from
               treatment by public or private providers in LMIC.Methods: We
               conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating the impact
               of public and private healthcare provision. We performed
               meta-analyses on data within identified studies, in order to
               estimate the effects of type of healthcare provision on
               identified health outcomes.Results: Twenty-one studies met our
               inclusion criteria and explicitly compared health outcomes
               between the public and private sectors. Of those, 17 were
               cohortstudies, from 9 countries. Eleven studies were conducted
               in lower-middle-incomecountries ($996--$3,945 GNI per capita)
               and 10 studies from upper-middle-incomecountries
               ($3,946--$12,195 GNI per capita). Eighteen studies were
               conducted inurban settings. Fifteen of the 21 studies provided
               mortality for a health outcome,and studies examined a wide range
               of diseases, with tuberculosis (TB) being themost represented. A
               meta-analysis of all studies exploring the impact of healthcare
               type and mortality showed that patients in a private healthcare
               setting are less likely to die than patients in a public
               healthcare setting (OR 0.60; 95\% CI 0.41--0.88). The pooled
               analysis showed that patients in a private healthcare facility
               are more likely to have unsuccessfully completed TB treatment
               than patients in a public healthcare facility (OR 2.04; 95\% CI
               1.07--3.89). Regardless of outcomes, the quality of evidence is
               rated, by objective measures, as either low or very low.
               Conclusions: More evidence is needed to compare health outcomes
               between the public and private sectors. Governments and
               researchers can play a critical role in improving the evidence
               base for decision making about the contributions of the public
               andprivate sectors in a given country's health
               system.Governments should encourage data collection in both
               public and private settings that would permit ongoing comparison
               of clinical data. When government facilities are absent or
               insufficient, contracting with private-sector facilities or
               providerswould appear to be an acceptable option. Governments
               must consider appropriateprofit margins, regulations and
               training for private providers.Further research is needed in
               this area, and should include low-income countriesand rural
               settings. Diseases of the poor -- notably malaria and childhood
               illnesses -- are largely absent from the current literature,
               with the exception of one study onHIV/AIDS and six on TB.",

  author    = "Barua, Bacchus and Jacques, David",
  abstract  = "Comparing the performance of different countries' health-care
               systems provides an opportunity for policy makers and the
               general public to determine how well Canada's health-care system
               is performing relative to its international peers. Overall, the
               data examined suggest that, although Canada's is among the most
               expensive universal-access health-care systems in the OECD, its
               performance is modest to poor.This study uses a ``value for
               money approach'' to compare the cost and performance of 28
               universal health-care systems in high-income countries. The
               level of health-care expenditure is measured using two
               indicators, while the performance of each country's health-care
               system is measured using 40 indicators, representing the four
               broad categories: [1] availability of resources; [2] use of
               resources; [3] access to resources; [4] quality and clinical
               performance.Five measures of the overall health status of the
               population are also included. However, these indicators can be
               influenced to a large degree by non-medical determinants of
               health that lie outside the purview of a country's health-care
               system and policies.Expenditure on health careCanada spends more
               on health care than the majority of high-income OECD countries
               with universal health-care systems. After adjustment for
               ``age'', the percentage of the population over 65, it ranks
               fourth highest for expenditure on health care as a percentage of
               GDP and tenth highest for health-care expenditure per
               capita.Availability of resourcesThe availability of medical
               resources is perhaps one of the most basic requirements for a
               properly functioning health-care system. Data suggests that
               Canada has substantially fewer human and capital medical
               resources than many peer jurisdictions that spend comparable
               amounts of money on health care. After adjustment for age, it
               has significantly fewer physicians, acute-care beds, and
               psychiatric beds per capita compared to the average of OECD
               countries included in the study (it ranks close to the average
               for nurses). While Canada has the most Gamma cameras (per
               million population), it has fewer other medical technologies
               than the average high-income OECD country with universal health
               care for which comparable inventory data are available.Use of
               resourcesMedical resources are of little use if their services
               are not being consumed by those with health-care demands. Data
               suggests that Canada's performance is mixed in terms of use of
               resources, performing at higher rates than the average OECD
               country on about half the indicators examined (for example,
               consultations with a doctor and knee replacement), and average
               to lower rates on the rest. Canada reports the least degree of
               hospital activity (as measured by discharge rates) in the group
               of countries studied.Access to resourcesWhile both the level of
               medical resources available and their use can provide insight
               into accessibility, it is also beneficial to measure
               accessibility more directly by examining measures of timeliness
               of care and cost-related barriers to access. Canada ranked worst
               on four of the five indicators of timeliness of care, and
               performed worse than the 10-country average on the indicator
               measuring the percentage of patients who reported that cost was
               a barrier to access.Quality and clinical performanceWhen
               assessing indicators of availability of, access to, and use of
               resources, it is of critical importance to include as well some
               measure of quality and clinical performance in the areas of
               primary care, acute care, mental health care, cancer care, and
               patient safety. While Canada does well on five indicators of
               clinical performance and quality (such as rates of survival for
               breast, colon, and rectal cancers), its performance on the seven
               others examined in this study are either no different from the
               average or in some cases---particularly obstetric traumas and
               diabetes-related amputations---worse.The data examined in this
               report suggest that there is an imbalance between the value
               Canadians receive and the relatively high amount of money they
               spend on their health-care system. Although Canada ranks among
               the most expensive universal-access health-care systems in the
               OECD, its performance for availability and access to resources
               is generally below that of the average OECD country, while its
               performance for use of resources and quality and clinical
               performance is mixed.",

               governmental insurance programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, or

               the country, and politicians and supporters of the two major
               political parties strongly disagree on the correct approach to
               healthcare. Recently, there have been many calls for complete

               life expectancy in the USA is lower than in most of the other
               developed countries and the infant mortality rate is generally
               higher. The USA remains the global leader in medical research
               and development. The USA also spends a large portion of its GDP
               on healthcare, higher than most other countries. Many claim that
               the inefficiencies and the bureaucracy involved in the system is
               to blame. Even those who have health insurance often struggle to
               pay the bills as the copays and deductibles are significantly
               higher than what most Americans have in savings. It should also
               be noted that the US physicians graduate with significant debt
               and therefore generally need higher incomes to pay them off when
               compared to physicians elsewhere. Canada is believed by many to
               have one of the best and most accessible healthcare systems in
               the world. The Canadian healthcare system is universal and
               publicly funded primarily through federal and provincial
               taxation and is informally referred to as Medicare. National
               health insurance coverage and access to a basic standard of
               healthcare is considered to be a fundamental human right of
               every Canadian citizen across the country. All the countries in
               the European Union, as well as the UK, provide universal
               healthcare to all residents. The individual systems vary. In the
               UK, Italy, and Sweden, the role of private insurance is limited,
               and almost all the medical services are provided and paid for
               through the public system. In Germany, the private health
               insurance is an essential component of the two-tiered system,
               although it is heavily regulated by the government to limit the
               annual out-of-pocket expenses. The French system is a mix of the
               two. The healthcare systems of India, Pakistan, and Latin
               American countries, despite significant problems, in many ways
               achieve outcomes that do not differ significantly from those of
               the developed countries. Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the
               United Arab Emirates, Australia, and New Zealand are some of the
               wealthiest countries in the world outside of North America and
               Europe. Their healthcare systems differ significantly, although
               each of them provides healthcare to almost all residents
               regardless of their financial abilities. In all of the
               aforementioned countries, residents pay some of the healthcare
               costs out of pocket, although significant safety nets exist.
               Singapore, unlike other countries, also has a mandatory savings
               program aimed at helping residents cover healthcare costs, an
               idea that is popular in some circles in America as well. The
               Australian and Singaporean systems in particular have been used
               as templates that the USA could use if a decision is made to
               restructure the healthcare system. The physicians in all of
               those countries earn good incomes and life expectancy of their
               patients is high.",

              measuring changes in health and health disparity",
  author   = "Wen, Chi Pang and Tsai, Shan Pou and Chung, Wen-Shen Isabella",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Universal national health insurance, financed jointly
              by payroll taxes, subsidies, and individual premiums, commenced
              in Taiwan in 1995. Coverage expanded from 57\% of the population
              (before the introduction of national health insurance) to 98\%.
              OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of national health insurance in
              improving life expectancy and reducing health disparities in
              Taiwan. DESIGN: A before-and-after comparison of the decade
              before the introduction of national health insurance (1982-1984
              to 1992-1994) with the decade after (1992-1994 to 2002-2004).
              SETTING: Taiwan. PATIENTS: All townships (n = 358) in Taiwan were
              ranked according to overall mortality rates before the
              introduction of national health insurance and then ranked into 10
              health class groups in descending order of health (groups 1
              [healthiest] to 10 [least healthy]). MEASUREMENTS: Health
              improvement (change in life expectancy after the introduction of
              national health insurance) and health disparity (reduction in the
              difference in life expectancy between the highest- and
              lowest-ranked health class groups). RESULTS: After the
              introduction of national health insurance, life expectancy
              increased more in health class groups that had higher mortality
              rates before the introduction of national health insurance and
              health disparity narrowed, reversing an earlier trend toward
              widening disparity. The major contributors to the reduction in
              disparity were relatively larger reductions in death from
              cardiovascular diseases, ill-defined conditions, infectious
              diseases, and accidents in the lower-ranked health class groups.
              However, death from cancer increased more in the lower-ranked
              health class groups. Utilization of medical services increased,
              whereas cost remained at 5\% to 6\% of the gross domestic
              product. The per capita average annual number of visits to the
              physician's office was 14. LIMITATION: The interpretation of
              comparisons before and after the introduction of national health
              insurance assumes that the changes were entirely due to the
              effect of national health insurance rather than secular trends.
              CONCLUSION: Life expectancy after the introduction of national
              health insurance improved more for lower-ranked health classes,
              resulting in narrowed health disparity. The magnitude of the
              reduced disparity was small compared with the size of the
              remaining gaps. Relying on universal insurance alone to eliminate
              health disparity does not seem realistic. To further reduce
              health disparity, universal insurance programs should incorporate
              primary prevention, focusing on lifestyle risk reductions.",

              and Washington, DC, that accepted the Affordable Care Act
              Medicaid expansion (Medicaid expansion states) and states that
              did not (non-Medicaid expansion states), stratifying data by
              race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Mean infant mortality rate in
              non-Medicaid expansion states rose (6.4 to 6.5) from 2014 to 2016
              but declined in Medicaid expansion states (5.9 to 5.6). Mean
              difference in infant mortality rate in Medicaid expansion versus
              non-Medicaid expansion states increased from 0.573 (P = .08) in
              2014 to 0.838 in 2016 (P = .006) because of smaller declines in
              non-Medicaid expansion (11.0\%) than in Medicaid expansion
              (15.2\%) states. The 14.5\% infant mortality rate decline from

              assessing the quality of healthcare systems. The World Health
              Organization underscores the importance of proper health care
              system in reducing preventable mortality through early
              intervention. Early intervention includes availability,
              accessibility and affordability of health care systems for
              children and mothers. While there are several studies that assess
              the immediate and underlying drivers of child mortality,
              literature on the role of policy measures are limited and
              inconsistent. Thus, robust empirical analysis of the determinants
              of maternal and infant mortality remains inconclusive in the era
              of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Here, we
              examined the influence of health expenditure on infant and
              maternal deaths for the period 2000-2015 across 177 countries.
              Using panel Quantile Regression with bootstrapping, this study
              accounted for the 2007-2008 financial crisis in an empirical
              relationship between health outcome and health expenditure. We
              found a negative effect of health expenditure on mortality across
              all percentiles. Infant mortality rate declines between 0.19\% -
              1.45\% while maternal mortality rate declines ranging from 0.09\%
              - 1.91\%. To attain the goal of ensuring healthy lives and
              wellbeing of all people (SDG 3), this study infers that health
              expenditure potentially reduces maternal and infant mortality
              across lower and middle income countries. We highlight the need

               sets: the National Socioeconomic Survey 2018, National Census of
               Villages 2018, Population Health Development Index 2018 and
               National Insurance Records to end 2017. Descriptive analysis and
               linear regression were performed. SETTING: Indonesia has one of
               the world's largest single-payer national health insurance
               schemes. Data are individual and district level; all are
               representative for each of the country's 514 districts.
               PARTICIPANTS: Anonymised secondary data from 1 131 825
               individual records in the National Socioeconomic Survey and 83
               931 village records in the village census. Aggregate data for

               service use and out-of-pocket payments, by health need,
               insurance status and service availability. Secondary outcome:
               insurance claims. RESULTS: Self-reported national health
               insurance registration (60.6\%) is about 10\% lower compared
               with the insurer's report (71.1\%). Insurance coverage is
               highest in poorer areas, where service provision, and thus
               service use and health spending, are lowest. Inpatient use is
               higher among the insured than the uninsured (OR 2.35, 95\% CI
               2.27 to 2.42), controlling for health need and access), and
               poorer patients are most likely to report free inpatient care
               (53\% in wealth quintile 1 vs 41\% in Q5). Insured patients
               spend US\$ 3.14 more on hospitalisation than the uninsured (95\%
               CI 1.98 to 4.31), but the difference disappears when controlled
               for wealth. Lack of services is a major constraint on service
               use, insurance claims and out-of-pocket spending. CONCLUSIONS:
               The Indonesian public insurance system protects many inpatients,
               especially the poorest, from excessive spending. However,
               others, especially in Eastern Indonesia cannot benefit because
               few services are available. To achieve health equity, the
               Indonesian government needs to address supply side constraints
               and reduce structural underfunding.",
