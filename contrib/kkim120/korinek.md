In class next week, I will ask each of you to write a paragraph about ways in which you might use some of the ideas in the paper in your own paper.  

I will incorporate LLMs for three purposes: text modification, data analysis, and coding. LLMs can check grammatical or spelling mistakes for non-native speakers as myself. Also, I found it interesting that LLMs can evaluate texts and offer a concise list of stylistic shortcomings of my texts such as an abstract. It is also helpful that LLMs can rewrite my writings. LLMs are very useful (I personally think this is the best aspect of using a LLM) in writing a wide variety of code. While it provides a variety of codes, it also does a good job in explaining the code for each line of code. Lastly, in terms of data analysis, LLms helps me create figures (providing code) and reformat data. I never knew LLMs could extract sentiment from the text, which is important for analyzing my citations.
