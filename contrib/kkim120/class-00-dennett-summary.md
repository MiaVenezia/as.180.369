here is my summary ... 
The act of counterfeiting, which refers to the creation of non-existent people, should be heavily punished in a society where it is easy to crate counterfeit people due to artificial intelligence. Countereiting originated from Alan Turing's turing Test as a benchmark to real thinking. With the development of AI, it is now impossible to tell if any text has been generated by an AI or a real person, leading to deeper challenge in the human trust. Creating counterfeit people is a threat not only to the economy but the civilization itself on the basis that democracy depends on "informed (not misinformed) consent of the governed" (The Atlantic). Counterfeit people will distract and confuse these informed people by leading them into temptation and subjugation. To be more precise, counterfeit people could potentially influence the informed public by manipulating them to consent to certain policies, government and business sector alike. There may be a solution to such threats regarding counterfeit people: to disclose AI information as a regulatory mandate by using systems like the EURion Constellation that protects currencies. Although it is highly costly for agencies to adopt such systems, increasing penalties or capital punishments for those who disable these watermarks that may lead to counterfeiting capabilities may hinder the development of such products. Many AI related professionals lose sense in the moral aspect of AI capabilities and should be reminded of such obligations.
