Inflation, an enduring economic phenomenon characterized by a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services, has long been recognized as a significant variable in the financial landscape. Its influence extends across various sectors of the economy, profoundly affecting investment decisions, consumer behavior, and overall market dynamics. Among the spheres impacted by inflation, the relationship between inflation and stock prices stands as a focal point of interest and scrutiny within the field of financial economics.

This literature review endeavors to delve into the multifaceted interplay between inflation and stock prices, particularly focusing on the United States. The stock market, being a crucial component of the financial system, is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Investors and policymakers keenly observe how inflationary trends may shape stock market behavior, impacting investment strategies, corporate valuations, and economic growth trajectories.

Understanding the dynamics of how inflation affects stock prices is paramount for investors seeking to optimize portfolio performance, economists aiming to model market behavior accurately, and policymakers formulating strategies to foster economic stability and growth. In this review, we seek to navigate the intricate relationship between inflation and stock prices within the U.S. context, synthesizing existing research, theories, and empirical findings to construct a comprehensive understanding of this crucial economic interaction. By examining the historical context, theoretical foundations, empirical studies, and policy implications, we endeavor to elucidate the intricacies of this relationship and shed light on potential avenues for further research and exploration.
